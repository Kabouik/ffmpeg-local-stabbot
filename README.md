# ffmpeg local stabbot
Little set of scripts for stabilizing videos in the same fashion as Reddit u/stabbot does.

Both are set to process the file that you pass as argument. 
By instance you will call:
ffmpeg.stabbot.bat shaky-video.mp4

The videotoolbox versions that I provided for Mac OS are a lot faster than the regular ones, but final quality ends up being worse.
